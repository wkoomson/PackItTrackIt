piti helps users keep track of their packages, by:

  1. automatically gathering online bought items in one place
    - Gathered through:
      * Searching through recent email for pkg #s and bought products
      * uSer manually adding pkg #s
  2. displaying info about the packages that are in the user's queue
    - Approximate Location
    - Estimated Time of Arrival
    - Product Name
    - Shipper
    - Retailer
  3. FUTURE:: giving push notifications

Ideally, the API will be developed first (backend), and then the webapps and
mobile apps (frontends) will be developed second.

API Use Case
  Before, she can use the api, dev gets an apikey from me, which is used to
  give access to the api.
  1 user creates an account using:
    built in OAuth
    Google OAuth
  2 user logs in to account
  3 user adds an email account to piti account
  4 user waits for pkgs to be gleaned
    system returns pkgs
  5 user views pkgs
  6 user deletes pkgs
  7 user adds packages
  8 user logs out
